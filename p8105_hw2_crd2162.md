## Problem 1: Cleaning and merging FiveThiryEight data

In the chunk below, we will clean the data in pols-month.csv. This data
comes from 538 and provides information on the number of national
politicians who are democratic or republican at any given time.

There are some values for which `prez_gop` is `2` – these are months in
which Ford became President following Nixon’s resignation. In the new
`president` variable created as part of our data cleaning, we code these
as `gop` (same as values when `prez_gop` is `1`).

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month_num = 1:12,
    month_abb = month.abb,
    month = month.name
  )

pols = 
  read_csv("data/pols-month.csv") |>
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    president = recode(prez_gop, "0" = "dem", "1" = "gop", "2" = "gop")) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, everything(), -day, -starts_with("prez")) 
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl  (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, r...
    ## date (1): mon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
    ## Joining with `by = join_by(month_num)`

In the chunk below, we will clean the data in snp.csv from 538. This
contains information related to Standard & Poor’s stock market index.

``` r
snp = 
  read_csv(
    "data/snp.csv",
    col_types = cols(date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y"))) |>
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    year = if_else(year > 2023, year - 100, year)) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, close) 
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(month_num)`

In the chunk below, we tidy the `unemployment` data so that it can be
merged with the `pols` and `snp` datasets.

``` r
unemployment = 
  read_csv("data/unemployment.csv") |>
  rename(year = Year) |>
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec, 
    names_to = "month_abb",
    values_to = "unemployment"
  ) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, unemployment)
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
    ## Joining with `by = join_by(month_abb)`

In the chunk below, we merge the three datasets.

``` r
data_538 = 
  left_join(pols, snp) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = unemployment)
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`
    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`

``` r
str(data_538)
```

    ## tibble [822 × 13] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
    ##  $ year        : num [1:822] 1947 1947 1947 1947 1947 ...
    ##  $ month       : chr [1:822] "January" "February" "March" "April" ...
    ##  $ month_num   : int [1:822] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
    ##  $ gov_gop     : num [1:822] 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 ...
    ##  $ sen_gop     : num [1:822] 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 ...
    ##  $ rep_gop     : num [1:822] 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 ...
    ##  $ gov_dem     : num [1:822] 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 ...
    ##  $ sen_dem     : num [1:822] 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 ...
    ##  $ rep_dem     : num [1:822] 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 ...
    ##  $ president   : chr [1:822] "dem" "dem" "dem" "dem" ...
    ##  $ month_abb   : chr [1:822] "Jan" "Feb" "Mar" "Apr" ...
    ##  $ close       : num [1:822] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
    ##  $ unemployment: num [1:822] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...

Notice that there are some `NA` values in the `close` and `unemployment`
variables, which indicate that the value of these variables is missing
at those locations.

Let’s talk about the 538 datasets. The `pols` data has 822 observations
and 11 variables and tells us about the party affiliation distribution
(democrat or republican) for governors and senators for a given year
from years 1947 to 2015. It also tells us whether the sitting president
was a democrat or republican. The `snp` data has 787 observations and 3
variables, ranging from years 1950 to 2015. The `unemployment` data has
816 observations and 3 variables ranging from years 1948 to 2015. In
Januarys in or after 1975 in which a democrat was president, the
**average unemployment rate was 6.57**. The average unemployment rate
over the same time period in which a republican was president was 6.47.

## Problem 2: Mr. Trash Wheel

In the chunk below, we will import the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset, which
contains information on the amount and types of litter collected by the
Mr. Trash Wheel vessel in Baltimore.

The homes_powered variable is mutated to reflect on average how many
households are powered by the amount of trash collected by Mr. Trash
Wheel (in tons). A new variable is created called `tw_type` which
distinguishes each named Trash Wheel from the other.

``` r
mtw_data = 
  read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", skip = 1,
            sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(row_number() != 585) |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = ((weight_tons * 500)/30),
    tw_type = "mtw",
    year = as.numeric(year),
    month = str_to_lower(month)
  ) |> 
  select(-x15, -x16)
```

    ## New names:
    ## • `` -> `...15`
    ## • `` -> `...16`

``` r
view(mtw_data)
```

In the chunk below, we will import, clean, and organize data for
Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda, two other types of trash wheels that
exist in the Baltimore Harbor.

``` r
ptw_data = 
  read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", skip = 1,
            sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(row_number() != 107) |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = ((weight_tons * 500)/30),
    tw_type = "ptw",
    sports_balls = NA,
    month = str_to_lower(month)
  ) |> 
  select (dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, plastic_bags, wrappers, sports_balls, homes_powered, tw_type)

gtw_data = 
  read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", skip = 1,
            sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(!(row_number() %in% c(156,157))) |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = ((weight_tons * 500)/30),
    tw_type = "gtw",
    glass_bottles = NA,
    sports_balls = NA,
    month = str_to_lower(month)
  ) |> 
 select (dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, plastic_bags, wrappers, sports_balls, homes_powered, tw_type)

view(gtw_data)
```

Now we will join all three datasets in the chunk below, creating a
combined dataset called `data_tw`.

``` r
data_tw = 
 bind_rows(mtw_data,ptw_data,gtw_data) 

view(data_tw)
```

The `data_tw` data has 845 observations and 15 variables and tells us
about the amount (such as weight and volume) and types of litter (such
as plastic bottles and cigarette butts) collected by three different
trash wheel vessels in the Baltimore Harbor: Mr. Trash Wheel, Professor
Trash Wheel, and Gwynnda Trash Wheel. The data was collected from 2014
to 2023.

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel was 216.26
tons.

The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021
was 1.63^{4}.
